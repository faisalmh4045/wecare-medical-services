# WeCare - a website for cardiology medical services.

Firebase project live site [link](https://healthcare-ass-10.web.app/).

* In this project, I'm creating an online platform for cardiology medical services.
* Here, visitors can login/register using email & password or they can use their google account.
* They can view service details while signed up using either method.
* For user authentication I'm using Firebase.
* And I've used React.js, React bootstrap and React router.
